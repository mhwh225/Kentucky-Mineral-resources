    Description:
      Abstract:
        Mineral resource occurrence data covering the world, most thoroughly
        within the U.S.  This database contains the records previously
        provided in the Mineral Resource Data System (MRDS) of USGS and the
        Mineral Availability System/Mineral Industry Locator System
        (MAS/MILS) originated in the U.S. Bureau of Mines, which is now part
        of USGS.

        The MRDS is a large and complex relational database developed over
        several decades by hundreds of researchers and reporters.  While
        database records describe mineral resources worldwide, the
        compilation of information was intended to cover the United States
        completely, and its coverage of resources in other countries is
        incomplete.

        The content of MRDS records was drawn from reports previously
        published or made available to USGS researchers.  Some of those
        original source materials are no longer available.

        The information contained in MRDS was intended to reflect the
        reports used as sources and is current only as of the date of those
        source reports.  Consequently MRDS does not reflect up-to-date
        changes to the operating status of mines, ownership, land status,
        production figures and estimates of reserves and resources, or the
        nature, size, and extent of workings.  Information on the
        geological characteristics of the mineral resource are likely to
        remain correct, but aspects involving human activity are likely to
        be out of date.
      Purpose:
        This digest of the complex mineral resources database is intended
        for use as reference material supporting mineral resource and
        environmental assessments on local to regional scale worldwide.
      Supplemental_Information:
        Current status: As of 2011, USGS has ceased systematic updates to
        MRDS, and is working to create a new database, focused primarily on
        the conterminous US. For locations outside the United States, MRDS
        remains the best collection of reports that USGS has available. For
        locations in Alaska, the Alaska Resource Data File remains the most
        coherent collection of such reports and is in continuing
        development.

        A small number of records (about 600) were updated slightly to
        support USGS studies in the western U.S. related to a land use
        change proposed by the Bureau of Land Management.

    Data_Set_Credit:
      Hundreds of people have contributed to the development of MRDS and
      MAS/MILS over several decades.  The present digest owes much of its
      coherence to Bill Ferguson, Bruce Lipin, and Paul Schruben of USGS.
  Data_Quality_Information:
    Attribute_Accuracy:
      Attribute_Accuracy_Report:
        Collected over many decades, this information is highly variable
        in quality.  Currency of individual records is variable as well,
        so it is likely that some information will be found to be out of
        date.  This is a subject of continuing refinement by the USGS and
        its cooperators.
    Logical_Consistency_Report:
      Collected and reported by numerous diverse people, the descriptions
      provided are not highly consistent in structure or terminology.
      Recent revision of the MRDS database has begun to address this
      issue, and the present database digest contains fields chosen for
      their general consistency, though much work remains to be done.
    Completeness_Report:
      The database is generally sparse; many records have no information
      for a given field.  A few fields required for proper processing
      are complete throughout.  The number of records lacking data in
      each field is shown in the list below with the percent of records
      lacking data for that field:

    Positional_Accuracy:
      Horizontal_Positional_Accuracy:
        Horizontal_Positional_Accuracy_Report:
          Positional information is highly variable.  In the best cases
          this information was provided by plotting the location on a 7.5
          minute topographic map, however many records were located on
          the basis of published reports containing imprecise or scant
          information on the specific geographic location.  Approximately
          4000 records have no reliable geographic coordinates, although
          about 114 of those have other locational information systematic
          enough to warrant placement within the controlled vocabulary
          used to select data for analysis on the web.

        Process_Description:
          Conversion of MRDS and MAS/MILS for use as a combined minerals
          database within the Oracle relational database management system
          proceeded under the general supervision of Bruce Lipin of USGS.

          Review of many database fields resulted in significant
          simplification, harmonization among records within these databases
          and between the databases, and elimination of duplicate records.

          The resulting relational database is currently maintained by
          William Ferguson under the supervision of Paul Schruben.

      Process_Step:
        Process_Description:
          Select fields and tables from the Oracle RDBMS are extracted using
          the script pull.php to produce local copies of the tables
          containing only those fields needed to produce the current digest.

          The script combine.php draws data from these local tables  to
          create a single monolithic table with one row per mineral resource
          record.

          At this writing a number of corrections are made to the data given
          for the form of orebodies.  These changes include the elimination
          of the useless value "SEE DEPOSIT DESCRIPTION COMMENTS", the
          elimination of empty parentheses from most records, replacement of
          the abbreviation 'IRREG' with the more common complete value
          'IRREGULAR', and especially a complex analysis of most values
          originating in the MAS/MILS database.  These changes are described
          by the script orebody-fix.php.

          Additional modifications are made to the geographic locations of
          about 4300 records whose coordinates are given in the source
          database as the South Pole.  These coordinates are replaced with
          NULL values in the current database.  The data selection software
          in the current distribution web site allows some of these records
          to be retrieved because some of the records contained additional
          information linking them to specific geographic areas.  These
          changes are carried out by the script place-fix.php.

          Information about host rocks and associated rocks was subject to
          additional correction using the SQL statements in fix-rock.php.

          This table is used to create the GIS shapefiles and other formats
          available for download.

          Production size.  A single character value.

          A broad characterization of the magnitude of production at the site.  The precise meanings of this field have changed over time and are lost to history; it is clear in retrospect that two different categorizations were used, a three-fold set based on magnitude (Small, Medium, Large) and a simple indicator (Yes or No), with some records showing U for unknown.  Modern specialists would prefer that such a categorization take into account the type of deposit and commodity at the site, but there is no evidence that approach was taken in assigning values to this field.

              Tectonite > Cataclasite

              A fine-grained, cohesive cataclastic rock, normally lacking a
              penetrative foliation or microfabric, formed during fault
              movement.

              Tectonite > Phyllonite

              A rock that macroscopically resembles phyllite but that is
              formed by mechanical degradation (mylonitization) of initially
              coarser rocks.

              Tectonite > Mylonite

              A compact, chert-like rock without cleavage, but with a streaky
              or banded structure, produced by the extreme granulation and
              shearing of rocks that have been pulverized and rolled during
              overthrusting or intense dynamic metamorphism.

              Tectonite > Flaser Gneiss

              A dynamically metamorphosed rock in which lenses or layers of
              original or relatively unaltered granular materials are
              surrounded by a matrix of highly sheared and crushed material,
              giving the appearance of a crude flow structure
