# MAP:673 Project Proposal
## 1.	Your data source and (at least a sample of) the data required to meet the map's objectives. 
https://tin.er.usgs.gov/mrds/ (sample in data folder)
## 2.	The map topic and geographic phenomena your map will explore.
a.	What?: Mineral Resources.
b.	Where?: Kentucky.
c.	When?: all discovered As of 2011.
d.	What is the tentative title of your project?: The distribution of Kentuckyâ€™s Mineral resources.
e.	Identify your anticipated methods of thematic representation methods (e.g., icons, choropleth, prop symbols, etc.): 
i.	Font: open sans or lato
ii.	Color: #fff with #000 border
iii.	Icon:  
iv.	Map type: heat
f.	Briefly describe your anticipated user interface (UI): a title, an info section, a legend that serves as a checklist to enable and disable different mineral resources. 

## 3.	An articulation of the map's objectives and user needs: 
a.	Why does the map need to be made? Consider your position to the mapping project. Why are you the one to be designing it?: the information is interesting and having a map to visualize it can help you better understand it. I am designing it because I want it to exist and no one else is going to make it.                      

b.	What type of user do you expect to use this map and what needs do you anticipate they will have?: people with a casual interest as experts likely already know this information and need more specialized maps. 

## 4.	A summary of the predicted technology stack.
a.	A description of the data and information processing tools used, e.g., QGIS, MapShaper, ArcGIS Pro, etc: just QGIS for now.

b.	The format you'll use to store your data, e.g., flat files such as CSV, GeoJSON, or dynamically from an API: I plan on using a CSV.

c.	The JS libraries you anticipate using or need like Leaflet, omnivore, Papa Parse, etc: Just leaflet for now more if I encounter problems achieving what I need.
